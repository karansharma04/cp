Steps in building a C++ project:
1. Preprocessing: based on Preprocessing directives like include, define, ifdef, etc
2. Compilation: converts cpp files -> object code files, not independently executable as unlinked
3. Linking: Takes all the object code files, and fetches the necessary library code based on the functions called in the code files, and combines them into a single standalone executable which can then be ran on the computer.
Static libraries: libraries whose code gets added during compile time
Dynamic libraries: whose code gets fetched and executed during run time
