malloc() :-
takes in  the size in bytes that the memory block should have, and returns void* if allocation successful and NULL otherwise
int *arr_ptr = (int *) malloc(N*sizeof(int));
 - does not initialize the bits in memory to 0 (actually does in my compiler)
calloc() :- 
takes number of blocks and size in bytes of each block
int *arr_ptr = (int *) calloc(N, sizeof(int));
realloc() :-
reallocating dynamically allocated memory
arr_ptr = (int *) realloc(arr_ptr, N*sizeof(int)); 

free() :-
used for deallocated dynamically allocated memory which was allocated using malloc, calloc or realloc
only deallocates memory, does not call any destructor like delete (which is an operator) does.
free(arr_ptr);
